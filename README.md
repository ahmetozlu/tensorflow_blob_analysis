# Tensorflow Blob Analysis
A sample project to perform blob analysis on images to detect blobs and analyze their shape features such as the presence, number, area, position, length, and direction of lumps.

## Quick Demo

Here is a demonstration of input and output image. Output image has maskings and bounding boxes around the blobs. The accuracy is perfect and blob shape features are predicted and calculated using the masked area and all these information are stored in proper csv files.
